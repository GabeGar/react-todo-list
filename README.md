# react-todo-list

## Goal

Create a todo project with some minimal functionality, in the react framework.

## Skills learned and applied

1. Learning and utilizing the vite build tool, for the first time, over webpack.
2. Basic React fundamentals (state management, creating re-useable components; to name some).
3. Conditional, In-line, editing.
4. Utilizing React Fragments, to avoid div soup.

## Thoughts

I had tried this project in vanilla JS, quite some time ago. Noticing how difficult it was at the time,
I trudged forth and saved this project, for when I got around learning React. Couldn't believe how much simpler it was to create this project utilizing the framework.

Overall, I found it fun and fairly challenging. Still getting to grips with the fundamentals of Reacts
but absolutely loving programming with it.
